# Final Report

## Introduction:

Universal Healthcare is one of the most valuable privileges we have in Canada that we often pay little mind to. In many other countries individuals seeking medical support often have the added fear of healthcare debt. This is what drew us to conduct our analysis on the medical costs in the privatized medical industry of the United States. We hoped to understand what factors further exacerbated or alleviated the burden of charges and understand these correlations. Conducive to this we focused our attention specifically on health related attributes such as smoker status and bmi then on situational attributes such as sex, region and parental status. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

We started our EDA with a simple exploration of the general details, trends and shape of our data to better understand what we had to work with and how we would utilize it to answer our research question.

- Put df.head here

This provided us with a basic understanding of the dataset by giving us the names of its columns and the type of data in each row

- Put df.describe here

We now had a summary of the important numerical imformation pertinent to answering both our reasearch questions

- Put bmi circle thing here

This figure shows the distribution charges for varying body mass indexes to help grasp a trend

{A summary of the highlights of your EDA, where you can show some visualizations of the exploratory data analysis your group did.}

## Question 1 + Results:

{Clearly state your research question, and include 2-3 visualizations that helped you answer your research question. You can create multi-panel figures, but each of your visualizations must speak directly to your research question, and any insights you were able to get from it should be clearly articulated in the figure caption/description.}

## Question 2 + Results:

{Clearly state your research question, and include 2-3 visualizations that helped you answer your research question. You can create multi-panel figures, but each of your visualizations must speak directly to your research question, and any insights you were able to get from it should be clearly articulated in the figure caption/description.}

## Summary/Conclusion:
