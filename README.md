## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With our analytics project we hope to show the effects of certain attributes such as age, geopgraphic region, sex , bmi and smoking/non-smoking on personal medical charges. We also hope to display how the privatized medical process in America and the subsqeuent charges it produces varies greatly from region to region. Also, we are interested to see whether we can plot "The regions with the oldest populatons and the highest charges".As individuals with access to free and readily available healthcare, the topic of Personal Medical Charges billed by Insurance companies set within a country characterized by a largely privatized medical industry is of great interest to us because the data set evidences the multiple attributes and demographic areas that influence personal medical cost. More definitively, we are interested in the variances in cost across age groups and measures of health such as smoking status and BMI and how these attributes can influence cost. 
The questions we wish to explore are as follows: 
-Is there any relevant correlation between the ratio of the quantitative variables such as age/charges.
-What is the correlation between the number of children or dependants and the amount of charges?
-Is there any relevant correlation between the ratio of sex/region compared to the subsequent charges.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The Medical Cost Personal Dataset was provided by Kaggle, a website dedicated to prividing a community for data science and machine learning interested individuals and organizations. The data contains information on the age of a primary beneficiary of a medical cost, sex of the beneficiary, Body max index, number of dependent children, status as a smoker and the individual medical cost billed by health insurance. Data was collected before 2013 and was last updated in 2017 with the purpose of providing data to aid in the study of machine learning. The dataset was originally extracted from "Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz" which collected the small dataset by a variety of means. I speculate that these columns relate to the most relevant factors correlated to major medical expenses.
